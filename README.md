## Code

### Dependencies

#### Python

Code has been developed with `Python 3.6.13`. It should work with other versions of `Python 3`, but has not been tested. Moreover, we rely on several third-party libraries, listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). They can be installed with

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Checkpoints

The tensorflow checkpoints for loading pre-trained network weights can be download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11v5-xXhPa6Rv6t5V2koeOM9MLdrxvWM9?usp=sharing). Unzip the folder and save it into this projects directory: "style-drumsynth/checkpoints".

### Usage

The code for generation is contained within the `drumsynth_demo.py` script, which enables conditional synthesises of drum sounds using a pretrained generator.

The following control parameters are available:
* Condition: which type of drum to generate (kick, snare or hat) 
* Direction: "Synthesis controls", which principal direction to move in [0:4]
* Direction slider: How far to move in a particular direction
* Number of generations: How many drums to generate
* Stocastic Variation: Amount of inconsequential noise to inject into the generator
* Randomize: Generate by randomly sampling the latent space, or generate from a fixed, pre-computed latent vectors for a kick, snare and hat
* Encode: regenerate drum sounds stored in the style-drumsynth/input_audio


Generations are saved in the style-drumsynth/generations folder.
To experiment encoding your own drums sounds, save your audio files in the "style-drumsynth/input_audio" directory.


#### drumsynth_demo.py arguments

```
  -c CONDITION,           --condition CONDITION
                            0: kick, 1: snare, 2:hat
  -d DIRECTION,           --direction DIRECTION
                            synthesis controls [0:4]
  -ds DIRECTION_SLIDER,   --direction_slider DIRECTION_SLIDER
                            how much to move in a particular direction
  -n NUM_GENERATIONS,     --num_generations NUM_GENERATIONS
                            number of examples to generate
  -v STOCASTIC_VARIATION, --stocastic_variation STOCASTIC_VARIATION
                            amount of inconsequential noise injected
  -r RANDOMIZE,           --randomize RANDOMIZE
                            if set to False, a fixed latent vector is used to generate a drum sound from each condition
  -e ENCODE,              --encode ENCODE
                            regenerates drum sounds from encoder folder
```
